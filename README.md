# Simple RISC Simulator

This repository contains a simple RISC simulator implemented in Python. The simulator is designed to execute a subset of instructions defined in the instruction set architecture (ISA) provided.

## Overview

The simulator reads a list of instructions from a file, simulates the execution of these instructions on a virtual CPU, and prints the state of registers and flags after each instruction. The supported instructions include arithmetic operations, data movement, comparison, branching, and special instructions.

## Features

- **Instruction Set:** Supports a variety of instructions including arithmetic operations (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`), data movement (`mov1`, `mov2`, `ld`, `st`), comparison (`cmp`), branching (`jmp`, `jlt`, `jgt`, `je`), and more.
- **Flags:** Includes support for flag registers to indicate results of comparisons.
- **Register File:** Simulates registers (`R0` to `R6`) and a flag register (`FLAGS`).
- **Error Handling:** Handles edge cases such as overflow, division by zero, and invalid instructions gracefully.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/atharvwarade/RISC-Assembler-and-Simulator
   cd Simple_CPU_Simulator
   ```

2. **Run the simulator:**
   ```
   python simulator.py

3. **Input File Format:**
   - Each instruction should be on a new line.
   - Instructions are in a specific format defined by the ISA.

4. **Output:**
   - After executing each instruction, the simulator outputs the current state of registers (`R0` to `R6`) and the flag register (`FLAGS`).

## Example

Suppose you have an input file `input.txt` with the following content:
```
add R1 R2 R3
mov1 R0 1010101
cmp R4 R5
jlt label
hlt
```
Running `python simulator.py input.txt` would produce output similar to:
```
